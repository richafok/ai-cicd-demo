# Copilot Instructions for AI Code Generation

## Overview
This document serves as a guideline for utilizing AI to generate code solutions based on issue tickets. It provides a structured approach to ensure consistency and quality in code generation.

## Guidelines

### 1. **Understanding the Issue Ticket**
   - Read the issue ticket thoroughly.
   - Identify the requirements and constraints stated in the ticket.
   - Look for examples or references that clarify the expected outcomes.

### 2. **Defining the Scope**
   - Determine which parts of the code need to be generated or modified.
   - Outline the functionality required to address the issue.
   - Clarify whether the ticket requires new code, modification of existing code, or both.

### 3. **Using AI for Code Generation**
   - Utilize AI tools to generate snippets of code relevant to the issue ticket.
   - Provide clear prompts to the AI, mentioning the problem and context.
   - Review generated code for adherence to coding standards and best practices.

### 4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Develop unit tests or integration tests for the newly generated code.
   - Validate that the code meets the requirements specified in the issue ticket.
   - Perform code reviews to ensure quality and maintainability.

### 5. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Document any new functions or classes created as a result of the code generation.
   - Comment on complex logic within the code to enhance readability.

### 6. **Feedback Loop**
   - Gather feedback from team members on the generated code.
   - Iterate on the generated code based on feedback to improve quality.

## Conclusion
Following these guidelines will ensure that the use of AI in code generation is effective, efficient, and conducive to maintaining high-quality code standards.
